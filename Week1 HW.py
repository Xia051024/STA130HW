#1.Pick one of the datasets

import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

#2.how many columns and rows of this data set has

import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"

# #definition of "Observations" and "Variables"
# According to chatgpt:
# Observations refer to individual instances or data points collected in a dataset. These represent the rows in a table or DataFrame.
# Variables are the characteristics, attributes, or properties that are measured or recorded for each observation. These are represented by the columns in a table or DataFrame.
# 
# So I would say:
# The datas of variables (columns) will change as the conditions given on the observations(rows). The various may have many categories, like ages, height and income. The various will focus more on a specific item or subject. However, the observation will more focus on the one aspect(time changing,quantities,etc.) of that item (or subject).

#3.Provide simple summaries of the columns in the dataset

import pandas as pd

# Load dataset from the provided URL
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"

#4.Explain the discrepancies

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# df.shape gives gives the overall size of the dataset, including all rows (observations) and columns 
df_shape=df.shape
print(df_shape)

# df.describe() provides a summary of numeric columns only by default, such as statistics like mean, count, standard deviation, etc.
#It also only includes non-missing (non-NaN) values in the "count" for each numeric column.
df_describe=df.describe(include='all')
print(df_describe)


# #5. Understand the difference between the following and then provide your own paraphrasing summarization of that difference
# 
# Attributes store data or properties about an object and are accessed without parentheses. Methods, on the other hand, perform an action or operation and typically require parentheses, even if no arguments are passed.
# 
# "df.shape" is  is an attribute that directly gives the size of the DataFrame.
# "df.describe()" is a method that performs an operation to generate statistical descriptions, so it needs parentheses to execute.

# #6. The df.describe() method provides the 'count', 'mean', 'std', 'min', '25%', '50%', '75%', and 'max' summary statistics for each variable it analyzes. Give the definitions (perhaps using help from the ChatBot if needed) of each of these summary statistics
# 
# 1）Count:
# The number of non-missing values (non-NaN) in the column. It shows how many valid data points are available for each variable.
# 2）Mean:
# The average of the values in the column, calculated as the sum of all values divided by the count of non-missing values.
# 3）Std (Standard Deviation):
# A measure of the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out, while a lower standard deviation means they are closer to the mean.
# 4）Min:
# The minimum value in the column, which represents the smallest number in the dataset for that variable.
# 5）25% (First Quartile or Q1):
# The value below which 25% of the data falls.
# 6）50% (Median or Second Quartile or Q2):
# The middle value of the data, with 50% of the values below and 50% above it. This is also known as the median.
# 7)75% (Third Quartile or Q3):
# The value below which 75% of the data falls. It represents the third quartile.
# 8)Max:
# The maximum value in the column, which represents the largest number in the dataset for that variable.

# 7.Missing data can be considered "across rows" or "down columns". Consider how df.dropna() or del df['col'] should be applied to most efficiently use the available non-missing data in your dataset and briefly answer the following questions in your own words

# Drop rows with any missing values using df.dropna

import pandas as pd

data = {'A': [1, 2, None, 4],
        'B': [5, None, None, 8],
        'C': [9, 10, 11, None]}
print(df)

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df_cleaned = df.dropna()
print(df_cleaned)

#Drop rows with any missing values using del df['col']

import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [4, 5, 6],
    'C': [7, 8, 9]
})

print(df)

# Delete column 'B'
del df['B']

print("\nDataFrame after deleting column 'B':")
print(df)


# 1.Provide an example of a "use case" in which using df.dropna() might be peferred over using del df['col']
# 
# When I want to delete the rows((or columns, if specified)) that contains at least one missing value, then df.dropna() is a better choice.
# 
# 
# 
# 2.Provide an example of "the opposite use case" in which using del df['col'] might be preferred over using df.dropna()
# 
# When I want to remove an entire column from the DataFrame, then del df['col'] is a better choice. 
# 
# 
# 
# 3.Discuss why applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() when both are used together could be important.
# 
# Maybe by using df['col'] first could help narrow the scope of what df.dropna() needs to detect. It can make dropna() more effeccient by reducing the amount of certain unuseful data.
# 

# In[30]:


# 4.Remove all missing data from one of the datasets you're considering using some combination of del df['col'] and/or df.dropna() and give a justification for your approach, including a "before and after" report of the results of your approach for your dataset.

import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, None, 4],
    'B': [None, 5, None, 7],
    'C': [7, None, 9, None],
    'D': [None, None, None, None]  # Column with all missing values
})

print(df)

 # Remove column 'D' which has all missing values
del df['D']
print(df)

# Drop rows with any remaining NaN values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()
print(df_cleaned)


# #As column D only has missing values'NaN", I first use del df[] to delete the whole column 'D' to narrow down the scope of what df.dropna() needs later to examine. After deleting the column which is certainly unuseful for me, I use dropna() to help me delete the rows with NaN values. First using del df[] simplifies the DataFrame and ensures that dropna() doesn’t unnecessarily operate on a column that would not impact the analysis.
# This process is far more effecient than first using dropna().

# 8. Give brief explanations in your own words for any requested answers to the questions below
#(1)Use your ChatBot session to understand what df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the "titanic" data set

import pandas as pd

Data_Frame=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv")
df=pd.DataFrame(Data_Frame)

df.groupby("survived")["pclass"].describe()





# (2) df.describe() provides statistics for each column independently and saperately, such as min, max, mean, etc. The count here reflects the number of non-missing values for each column across the entire dataset.
# Since it treats each column separately and doesn't consider relationships between columns, the count for different columns may vary depending on how much missing data is in each column.
# On the other hand, df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() counts the data by values in "col1" and provides statistics for "col2" within each group. The count here shows how many non-missing values of "col2" exist for each group in "col1".

# (3) (a) Working in a ChatBot session to fix the errors is better for me.

# 9. Somewhat

#  ChatBot summaries
# 
# 1. **Understanding the Difference Between `df.shape` and `df.describe()`**:
#    - You explored how `df.shape` returns the dimensions of the DataFrame (rows, columns), while `df.describe()` provides summary statistics like mean, count, min, max, etc. for numerical columns.
# 
# 2. **Titanic Dataset Analysis**:
#    - You worked with the Titanic dataset from a CSV file and aimed to perform some simple summary analyses, such as investigating missing values and exploring differences between `df.describe()` and using `groupby()` to understand data grouped by categories.
# 
# 3. **Explanation of `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()`**:
#    - We discussed how `df.groupby()` works, where it groups data by a column (`col1`) and then applies descriptive statistics (`describe()`) to another column (`col2`). This method gives you statistics for `col2` within each group of `col1`.
# 
# 4. **Pandas DataFrame Functions Overview**:
#    - You asked for an explanation of how to use different DataFrame functions like `head()`, `info()`, `drop()`, `fillna()`, `groupby()`, and others to manipulate and analyze data.
# 
# 5. **Difference Between `df.describe()` and `df.groupby().describe()`**:
#    - We discussed how `df.describe()` provides global summary statistics for the entire dataset, while `df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()` groups the data by a column and calculates statistics for each group, showing how the data is distributed across categories.
# 
# 6. **Handling `NameError` in DataFrame Creation**:
#    - You encountered an error when trying to create a DataFrame. The issue was resolved by correctly importing the Pandas library and using `pd.DataFrame()`.
# 
# 7. **Pandas DataFrame Operations**:
#    - **`del df['col']`**: Used to remove an entire column from a DataFrame.
#    - **`df.dropna()`**: Used to remove rows or columns with missing values.
# 
# 8. **Difference Between `del df['col']` and `df.dropna()`**:
#    - **`del df['col']`**: Removes a specific column, which might be useful when the column is irrelevant or redundant.
#    - **`df.dropna()`**: Removes rows or columns with any missing values, which helps in cleaning data by ensuring completeness.
