    "For extension 1:\n",
    "The extension introduces a more complex Markov model by considering pairs of words (bigrams) instead of single words. Here's a quick rundown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`word_used2`**: This dictionary counts occurrences of bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) in your text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`next_word2`**: This nested dictionary tracks how often each bigram is followed by a third word. \n",

    "This extension adds a character-based dimension to your Markovian chatbot model. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`characters`**: This `Counter` object counts occurrences of each character in the `avatar.character` column after normalizing the text (converting to uppercase and replacing spaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`nested_dict`**: This lambda function creates nested `defaultdict` objects, allowing you to build a multi-level dictionary structure easily.\n",

    "If \"the quick brown\" appears once after \"the quick\", then next_word2[\"the quick\"][\"brown\"] will be 1.\n",

    "Here’s a summary of our conversation so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Markovian Chatbot Models:**\n",
    "   - We discussed various extensions of a Markov model for a chatbot, including basic bigram models and character-specific models.\n",
    "   - Extension #1 used bigrams to track word pairs and their following words.\n",
    "   - Extension #2 added a character dimension, tracking bigrams and their subsequent words for different characters in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Career Opportunities:**\n",
    "   - We explored how skills in learning and adaptability, communication, coding, and statistics can enhance career opportunities.\n",
    "   - Each skill contributes to versatility, effective problem-solving, and strong professional communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Becoming a Statistician or Data Scientist:**\n",
    "   - We discussed the core skills required for these roles. Statisticians need strong statistical knowledge, data analysis skills, and proficiency in statistical software. Data scientists need coding skills, expertise in data analysis and machine learning, data visualization abilities, and strong mathematical and statistical knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the conversation focused on enhancing chatbot models, leveraging key skills for career growth, and the essential skills needed for roles in statistics and data science.\n",

    "I would like to major in math or statistics in the future, which may require me to study coding and statistics. I may also specialize in math in the future. It depends on my interest and my ability of learning. But there will always be no escape from statistics and math. I don't think I can become a researcher or scientist in these fields, but I want to work on related jobs. I would like to use what I've learned in college in my work, which would help me adapt faster to jobs. I hope the things I learned in college could help me specifically in my life and work, not just broadening my eyesights.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.5\n",
    "I would say chatgpt gives me a relatively deep explanation for the code or question I provide. When I ask it with some basic functions in python, it will explain in a beginner-friendly way, giving me examples to help me understand. And for the code I want it to explain, I think it might answer too general. I need to narrow down every line of my code to ask it how the codes work. It just gives me a brief explanation, which is less helpful. In general, the explanation the chat gives is readable. But for some cpmlex codes, I don't think it could explain better than my teachers or classmates. This might because chat does not know the level of my understanding of python. It just give general explanation.\n",
